# ðŸŽ° Casino Slot Machine (Go)

A lightweight command-line slot machine game written in Go. Spin the reels and test your luck!

## Features

- **Simple Gameplay**: Engage with a classic slot machine experience directly from your terminal.
- **Randomized Outcomes**: Utilizes Go's `math/rand` package to generate random symbols for each spin.
- **Modular Codebase**: Organized into separate files for main execution (`main.go`), spinning logic (`spin.go`), and utility functions (`util.go`).
